Changelog
=========

1.0.10 (unreleased)
-------------------

- Pre-select the first operation when adding an operator in the
  browser.
  [maurits]

- Remove disabled indexes from the config, otherwise we needlessly
  include them in json.
  [maurits]

- Support showing the original criteria readonly.  This can be handy
  when you have large selection criteria.  ``show_original_criteria``
  in the widget is False by default.
  [maurits]

- Added widget property ``show_parent_criteria``, which is True by
  default.  This shows the parent criteria readonly in the edit form.
  [maurits]

- When getting the results, get the ``querybuilderresults`` multi
  adapter, instead of hardcoding the use of the standard
  ``QueryBuilder`` from ``plone.app.querystring``.  This way, add-ons
  can override the default behavior.
  [maurits]

- Support recursive fields by default, merging the value of the parent
  in the query.
  [maurits]

  yet updated at this point in the event call.

  dls.
  See http://dev.plone.org/ticket/12964
  [esteele]


1.0.2 (2012-04-15)
